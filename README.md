## HF Index 
Taken from the creators:

The Human Freedom Index presents a broad measure of human freedom, understood as the absence of coercive constraint. 
It uses 79 distinct indicators of personal and economic freedom in the following areas:
- Rule of Law
- Security and Safety
-  Movement
- Religion
- Association, Assembly, and Civil Society
- Expression and Information
- Identity and Relationships
- Size of Government
- Legal System and Property Rights
- Access to Sound Money
- Freedom to Trade Internationally
- Regulation of Credit, Labor, and Business


The HFI is the most comprehensive freedom index so far created for a globally meaningful set of countries. The HFI covers 162 countries for 2016, the most recent year for which sufficient data are available and it includes three countries -Belarus, Iraq, and Sudan- that were added this year. The index ranks countries beginning in 2008, the earliest year for which a robust enough index could be produced.
